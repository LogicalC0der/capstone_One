# capstone_One
First capstone project, a tongue in cheek resume to lock in basic HTML refresh skills

This html file is created to lock in basic code lessons such as the struture of a html file, from <!DOCTYPE> through </html>

Will create a more serious resume once I'm able to create something more pride worthy
